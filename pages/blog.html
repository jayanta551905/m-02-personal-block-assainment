                <h3>Floating Guava market in Jahalokati</h3>
                <h5>September 10, 2022</h5>
                <p class="blog-content-description">The floating market appears as the center of Barisal’s (aka The Venice of Bengal) beauty. Nobody knows when the idea of this floating market began, but it’s a hundred-year-old tradition. Development and modernization are taking over the country but it’s surprising to see them not reaching this river-oriented life yet. For more than 100 years, the local farmers have been experiencing the ups and downs of life along with the ebb and flow of the river. Many farmers and wholesalers gather here every day. Not the only guava, but there are also other fruits sold in this market.
                The southern region of Bangladesh is famous for guavas, more popularly known in Bangladesh as ‘Bengal’s Apple’. Especially in Jhalakathi Sadar Upazila and at Swarupkathi and Banaripara Upazila in Pirozpur, farmers heavily rely on guava farming. Such diversity of life is hard to be found in other places in the country. Loss in guava farming in one season usually leads to extreme distress for the farmers throughout the year. The current year is one of those....

                <h3>River of Barisal</h3>
                <h5>January 1, 2023</h5>
                <p class="blog-content-description">Barisal, officially called Barishal, city, south-central Bangladesh. It lies in the delta of the Padma (Ganges [Ganga]) and Jamuna (Brahmaputra) rivers on the Kirtonkhola, an offshoot of the Arial Khan River.
                Incorporated as a municipality in 1876, it is a trade centre, most notably for rice, jute, and fish. It is linked by ship with Dhaka, about 73 miles (117 km) to the north, Chittagong, to the southeast, and Khulna, to the southwest. Barisal is home to several government colleges, including the Sher-e-Bangla Medical College, as well as dozens of private higher-education institutions. Barisal gives its name to a curious natural phenomenon known as the Barisal guns, thundering noises heard in the delta and apparently coming from the sea. The sounds have not been satisfactorily explained. ...

                <h5>February 29, 2023</h5>
                <p class="blog-content-description">During the Mughal Empire, Sheikh Enayet Ullah, Zamindar of the Jamalpur Porgona district, had a garden house on this property and later added a palace, which he called Rongmohol. He was buried on the northeast corner of the palace yard but his gravesite was ruined at the beginning of the 20th century. His son Sheikh Moti Ullah sold the property to French traders, who erected a trading house beside the property. After changing hands a number of times over the next several centuries, the property was purchased by Khwaja Alimullah in the 1800s. Alimullah renovated the property, turning the trading house into a residence and adding a stable and family mosque....
